## Tile Crack Detection With U-Net
 This project is for detecting tile cracks in images using digital image processing and deep learning. Given a tile image and its pattern, it will give us the crack by a segmentation task, and U-Net was used for this part.

### How to run

In the tile-crack-detection folder, change the directories according to yours and run "run_me.ipynb".
